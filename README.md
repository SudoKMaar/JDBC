# JDBC Project - 3rd Semester üìö

Welcome to my Basic JDBC Project repository! This collection of source code represents my exploration of Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) during my third semester of college. Through this project, I learned how to interact with databases, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and manage student information in a database.

## Introduction

During my third semester, I delved into the world of database interaction using Java JDBC. This project showcases my understanding of establishing connections, executing queries, and managing student records in a database. The source code reflects my journey of learning and applying JDBC concepts.

## Features

- **Database Interaction:** The source code demonstrates how to establish a connection to a MySQL database, perform CRUD operations, and manage student records.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The console-based user interface makes it easy to add, view, update, and delete student information interactively.
- **Reusable Components:** The project is organized into separate classes for database connectivity, student operations, and main program execution.
- **Educational Purpose:** This project serves as an educational resource for those looking to understand the basics of JDBC and how it can be used to interact with databases in Java.

## Usage

To explore and run this Basic JDBC Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SudoKMaar/sem3-jdbc.git
   ```

2. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the project directory.

3. Compile the source code using Java Compiler:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

4. Run the main program:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

5. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the student management system.
